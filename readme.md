### One vulnerable driver to learn all.

The best vulnerable driver to learn all methods to exploit kernel vulnerability.

There is an vulnerable linux driver which contains 5 vulnerabilities. They are UAF / arbitrary read and write / uninitialized stack variable / buffer overflow / null pointer dereference. 

And there are exploiting scripts for each bug.

You can read [my blog](https://xz.aliyun.com/u/20655) to learn how to exploit linux kernel vulnerability.
